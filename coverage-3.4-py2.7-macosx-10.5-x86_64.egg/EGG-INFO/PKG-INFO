Description: Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test execution. It uses
        the code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard
        library to determine which lines are executable, and which have been executed.
        
        Coverage.py runs on Pythons 2.3 through 3.2.

        New in 3.4: Better control over source to measure, and unexecuted files
        can be reported.
